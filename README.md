VPC with Public and Private Subnets for Production Environment Setup on AWS
his project demonstrates the setup of a resilient Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for production environment servers on AWS. Servers are deployed across two Availability Zones using an Auto Scaling group, ensuring high availability and scalability. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is used to distribute traffic efficiently. For enhanced security, the servers reside in private subnets and only accept traffic through the load balancer. Internet access is provided via a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway, deployed in both Availability Zones for improved redundancy and fault tolerance, ensuring seamless connectivity while maintaining security and performance.
